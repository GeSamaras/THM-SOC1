Splunk has three main components, namely Forwarder, Indexer, and Search Head. These components are explained below:

**Splunk Forwarder**

Splunk Forwarder is a lightweight agent installed on the endpoint intended to be monitored, and its main task is to collect the data and send it to the Splunk instance. It does not affect the endpoint's performance as it takes very few resources to process. Some of the key data sources are:

- Web server generating web traffic.
- Windows machine generating Windows Event Logs, PowerShell, and Sysmon data.
- Linux host generating host-centric logs.
- Database generating DB connection requests, responses, and errors.

**Splunk Indexer**  

Splunk Indexer plays the main role in processing the data it receives from forwarders. It takes the data, normalizes it into field-value pairs, determines the datatype of the data, and stores them as events. Processed data is easy to search and analyze.

**Search Head**

Splunk Search Head is the place within the Search & Reporting App where users can search the indexed logs as shown below. When the user searches for a term or uses a Search language known as Splunk Search Processing Language, the request is sent to the indexer and the relevant events are returned in the form of field-value pairs.

Search Head also provides the ability to transform the results into presentable tables, visualizations like pie-chart, bar-chart and column-chart, as shown below:

Splunk can ingest any data. As per the Splunk documentation, when data is added to Splunk, the data is processed and transformed into a series of individual events. 

The data sources can be event logs, website logs, firewall logs, etc.

Data sources are grouped into categories. Below is a chart listing from the Splunk documentation detailing each data source category.

**Interesting log Sources**  

Some of the interesting log sources that will help us in our Investigation are:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Log Sources**|**Details**|
|**wineventlog**|It contains Windows Event logs|
|**winRegistry**|It contains the logs related to registry creation / modification / deletion etc.|
|**XmlWinEventLog**|It contains the sysmon event logs. It is a very important log source from an investigation point of view.|
|**fortigate_utm  <br>**|It contains Fortinet Firewall logs|
|**iis  <br>**|It contains IIS web server logs|
|**Nessus:scan  <br>**|It contains the results from the Nessus vulnerability scanner.|
|**Suricata  <br>**|It contains the details of the alerts from the Suricata IDS.   This log source shows which alert was triggered and what caused the alert to get triggered— a very important log source for the Investigation.|
|**stream:http  <br>**|It contains the network flow related to http traffic.|
|**stream: DNS  <br>**|It contains the network flow related to DNS traffic.|
|**stream:icmp  <br>**|It contains the network flow related to icmp traffic.|
**Note:** All the event logs that we are going to investigate are present in the `index=botsv1`
